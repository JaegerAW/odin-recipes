# odin-recipes
In this project, I'm going to practice on what I've learned so far, which includes:
1. Creating a repository on github
2. Cloning the repository via terminal to my repos folder
3. Building a homepage index.html along with its recipe pages, making sure the folders are in place accordingly.
4. Practice git add and git commit before finally git pushing the project onto github.
